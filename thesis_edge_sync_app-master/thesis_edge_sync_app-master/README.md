## 📌 About

This repository contains the core implementation and architectural documentation for **EdgeSync** — my undergraduate thesis project under the BS Computer Science program.

EdgeSync is built to solve a recurring problem in Philippine universities: **network congestion during large-scale events renders traditional web-based attendance systems unusable.** The system shifts critical validation and storage logic to the edge (local scanning devices), ensuring zero-downtime logging regardless of venue infrastructure.

This repo is structured around a **proof-of-concept implementation**, focusing on:
- Cryptographic QR payload validation
- Local state persistence using embedded databases
- Asynchronous reconciliation with a central cloud server

---

## 🎯 The Problem Context

Traditional web-based attendance systems critically fail during large-scale university events due to:
- Network congestion and bandwidth throttling
- Localized Wi-Fi drops
- Bottlenecked queues and missing data

Organizers are forced to revert to inefficient **pen-and-paper tracking**, which introduces data entry errors, delays, and manual reconciliation overhead.

## ⚙️ The Engineering Solution

EdgeSync eliminates real-time cloud dependency by shifting data validation and storage directly to the **edge** (the local scanning device). This architecture guarantees:

- ✅ **Zero-downtime** event logging regardless of venue infrastructure
- ✅ **Cryptographic verification** of QR payloads without querying a live database
- ✅ **Asynchronous state reconciliation** when network connectivity is restored

## 🧠 Core System Mechanics

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cryptographic Edge Validation** | Student QR payloads are embedded with secure HMAC signatures. The local offline scanner verifies a code's authenticity instantly, preventing spoofing without live database queries. |
| **Local State Persistence** | Scanned records are immediately committed to an embedded local database (e.g., SQLite). This ensures high-throughput, latency-free scanning by decoupling from remote APIs. |
| **Asynchronous State Reconciliation** | Upon network restoration, the system packages verified batch logs and pushes them to the central cloud server. Conflict resolution ensures duplicate scans are deduplicated before final insertion. |
